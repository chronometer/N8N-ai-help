## 🎯 Golden Rules

### 1. Clear Purpose
Every workflow should have a single, clear purpose. If doing multiple things, split into sub-workflows.

### 2. Error Handling
Every workflow must handle errors gracefully. Never assume success.

### 3. Data Validation
Always validate input data before processing.

### 4. Logging
Add logging for debugging and monitoring.

### 5. Documentation
Document what your workflow does and why.

### 6. Testing
Test workflows before deploying to production.

### 7. Monitoring
Monitor workflows in production and alert on failures.

## 🛡️ Security Essentials

- **Never hardcode credentials** - Use credentials system
- **Validate all input** - Don't trust external data
- **Sanitize outputs** - Prevent injection attacks
- **Use HTTPS** - Encrypt data in transit
- **Secure credentials** - Use environment variables
- **Audit access** - Track who runs workflows
- **Limit permissions** - Principle of least privilege

See [Security](security.md) for details.

## ⚡ Performance Essentials

- **Batch operations** - Process multiple items efficiently
- **Cache results** - Avoid repeated calls
- **Minimize API calls** - Respect rate limits
- **Use appropriate models** - GPT-3.5 vs GPT-4 cost/performance
- **Handle timeouts** - Set reasonable timeouts
- **Monitor execution time** - Track performance
- **Optimize queries** - Filter data early

See [Performance](performance.md) for details.

## 🐛 Error Handling Essentials

- **Expect failures** - APIs go down, networks fail
- **Implement retries** - Retry transient failures
- **Log errors** - Know what went wrong
- **Fail gracefully** - Don't crash silently
- **Alert appropriately** - Know when help is needed
- **Human review** - Important operations need approval
- **Test error paths** - Don't just test happy path

See [Error Handling](error-handling.md) for details.

## 🏗️ Recommended Architecture

### Single Workflow Structure

```
Trigger → Validate → Process → Error Handling → Output
```

### Complex Workflow Structure

```
Trigger
  ↓
Validate Input
  ↓
Get Configuration
  ↓
Main Processing
  ├→ Path A
  ├→ Path B
  └→ Path C
  ↓
Combine Results
  ↓
Format Output
  ↓
Error Handler (catches all)
  ↓
Final Action/Output
```

### Multi-Workflow Architecture

```
Main Workflow
  ├→ Sub-workflow 1
  ├→ Sub-workflow 2
  └→ Sub-workflow 3
     ↓
   Combine Results
```

- Test each step
- Add error handling

### 3. Testing
- Test happy path
- Test error cases
- Load test if needed

### 4. Documentation
- Document purpose
- Document steps
- Document errors

### 5. Deployment
- Review with team
- Deploy to staging

## 💾 Common Pitfalls

### Pitfall 1: No Error Handling
**Problem:** Workflow fails silently.
**Solution:** Add error handling to all nodes.

### Pitfall 2: Hardcoded Credentials
**Problem:** Credentials exposed in workflow.
**Solution:** Use credentials system.

### Pitfall 3: No Logging
**Problem:** Can't debug when issues occur.
**Solution:** Add comprehensive logging.

### Pitfall 4: Untested Workflows
**Problem:** Errors discovered in production.
**Solution:** Test thoroughly before deploying.

### Pitfall 5: No Monitoring
**Problem:** Don't know when workflows fail.
**Solution:** Monitor and alert on failures.

### Pitfall 6: Complex Monolithic Workflows
**Problem:** Hard to maintain and debug.
**Solution:** Break into smaller workflows.

## 📚 Quick References

### Naming Conventions

**Workflows:**
```
descriptive-workflow-name
e.g., sync-salesforce-to-sheets
```

**Nodes:**
```
Descriptive Node Name
e.g., Validate Email Input
```

**Variables:**
```
camelCase
e.g., customerEmail, processedData
```

### Code Style

```javascript
// Use descriptive names
const customerEmails = data.map(item => item.email);

// Add comments for complex logic
// Check if email is valid before processing
if (isValidEmail(email)) {
  // Process email
}

// Use consistent formatting
return [
  {
    id: 1,
    name: 'John',
    processed: true
  }
];
```
